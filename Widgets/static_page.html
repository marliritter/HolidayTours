                  <div class="pane">
                    <p>It is most frustrating to seek advice and assistance from a travel agent or tour operator who has little or no experience of a particular country. Would you ask your G.P. to do your heart surgery or would you want it
                        done by a specialist? Your holiday is an expensive investment.
                        So make sure you get the best advice possible. Our key consultants visit their destinations regularly so that they have the most up to date first hand experience of the destination.
                        They inspect the hotels and resorts we use and they familiarise themselves with the tours, excursions, cruises, train journeys and coach holidays etc, to make sure that we bring you the very best there is. </p>
